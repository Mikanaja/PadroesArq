# DeepRealApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.

### Node.js

This project requires Node.js version 18.20.6 or later. If you do not have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Angular CLI

Angular CLI is a command-line interface for Angular. To install Angular CLI, run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
